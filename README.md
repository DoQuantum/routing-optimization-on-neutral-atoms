# 🧑‍🔬 Research Team GitHub Guide - Reccomendations

Welcome to your research repository! This guide will help you work together using Git and GitHub — no prior experience needed. Feel free to modify this, it's only for your introduction to your team's repo.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

**Clone your repository** to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG-NAME/YOUR-TEAM-REPO.git
   ```

## 🌿 Branching Workflow
Always work on a separate branch. Never push directly to main.

1. Create a new branch for each task or feature
bash
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-your-name

2. Make your changes locally
Work on your files as needed — save your progress often.

3. Stage and commit your changes
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"

4. Push your branch to GitHub
    ```bash
    git push origin feature-your-name

5. Open a Pull Request (PR)
    - Go to the repo on GitHub
    - Click "Compare & pull request"
    - Add a short description of your changes
    - Tag a teammate to review it

Once approved, it can be safely merged into main.

## 📌 Commit Message Tips
Write clear, useful messages that explain what and why, like:

- `Add quantum state simulation function`
- `Fix matrix dimensions in tensor product`
- `Update README with cloning instructions`

## 🔁 Keeping Your Repo Up to Date
Always sync with the main branch before starting new work:
```bash
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  Then create your feature branch from the updated main.
  ```

## 🧠 Best Practices
- ✅ One branch per feature or fix
- ✅ Pull frequently to avoid merge conflicts
- ✅ Keep your code well-commented and organized
- ✅ Use README.md for explanations
- ✅ Track bugs, tasks, or ideas with GitHub Issues
- ✅ Communicate often in your team chat and meetings, get to know eachother outside of work (lunch, dinner, night on the town)
